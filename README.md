About Me
My passion for building and creating objects took off when I learned how to create them in Object-Oriented Programming. Software development has never been just a job for me, but more a path that I found myself on as interaction and engagement with people online has become more nuanced. I have made a few projects that can showcase my background in development in software. ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding jobs. âœ¨ Currently learning AWS Lambda, Dart-language for Flutter, and Redux.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web development and mobile applications.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects as I would love to answer any questions concerning them and their state.
